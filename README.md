#### Hola! Hima Bindu here...  :mask:
I wonder what you are doing here on my profile... but anyway. Nice to see you.

I'm a CS undergrad at [GVPCE(A)](http://gvpce.ac.in/index1.html), a Scholar in Google's Women Tech-Makers Engineering Fellows, Core member in GVP-DSC club. 

I'm kinda **"Jack of all trades"**.

#### What's cooking :grey_question:
- Reading "Cateogry Theory for programmers" by Bartosz Milewski.
- Learning about Databases
- programmingggggg

#### We can talk about...
- Python, C, Cpp, Haskell, Java.
- Mathematics, Data structures, Algorithms, and Competitive programming.
- Stupid-weird-psychological-philosophical things too!

#### Reach me on...
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BinduTenneti) - I tweet mostly about pragmatic stuff, puns and anything that interests me!
