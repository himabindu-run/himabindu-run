#### Hola! Hima Bindu here... [She/her]
_____________________________________________________________________
I'm a CS undergrad at [GVPCE(A)](http://gvpce.ac.in/index1.html), a Theoretical CS and mathematics enthusiast. I like solving problems and making lists.

#### What's cooking :grey_question:
- Trying my Hands on ML with a Peer group.
- Trying to solve more problems.
- Exploring cool stuff in Maths.

#### We can talk about...
- Python, C, C++, Haskell, Java.
- Mathematics, Data structures, Algorithms, and Clean Code.
- Stupid-weird-psychological-philosophical stuff too!

:eyes: No Fun Facts! I am the "FUN".
