I'm a CS undergrad at [GVPCE(A)](http://gvpce.ac.in/index1.html), a Theoretical CS and mathematics enthusiast. Oh yeah, I am also Scholar in WE program(Formerly known as Google's Women Tech-Makers Engineering Fellows), IEEE GVP'S student branch CS society Vice Chair,  Core member in GVP-DSC club, and a great To-Do list writer.

#### What's cooking :grey_question:
- Reading "Learn a you a Haskell for great good" and solving some problems in Haskell.
- Exploring Theory of computation and stuff.
- Learning Java(Not interesting).
- Trying to solve more problems. 
- Learning Data Structures and Algorithms(This is never ending).

#### We can talk about...
- Python, C, Cpp, Haskell, Java.
- Mathematics, Data structures, Algorithms, and Clean Code.
- Stupid-weird-psychological-philosophical things too!

:eyes: No Fun Facts! I am the "FUN".
