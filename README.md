### Hola!:wave: Hima Bindu here...  :mask:
I wonder what you are doing here on my profile... but anyway. Nice to see you.

I'm a CS undergrad at [GVPCE(A)](http://gvpce.ac.in/index1.html), a Scholar in Google's Women Tech-Makers Engineering Fellows, Core member in GVP-DSC lead and a perfect todo list writer and time table maker!

I'm kinda **"Jack of all trades"**.
Apparently, that allows me to learn various stuff!

### What's cooking:grey_exclamation::grey_question:
**Mainly fighting for productivity in this ball game ~sigh**
- Learning how to learn:grey_exclamation:
- Reading "Cateogry Theory for programmers" by Bartosz Milewski.
- Learning about Databases
- Trying Home automation etc.. 
- programmingggggg


### We can talk about... :computer: 
- Python, C, Cpp and Haskell(If and only if you want to be Adventurous xD)
- Mathematics, Data structures, Algorithms, and Competitive programming.
- Stupid-weird-psychological-philosophical things too!

### Reach me on...
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BinduTenneti) - I tweet mostly about pragmatic stuff, puns and anything that interests me!

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hima-bindu-002a45194/) - If you want to reach me in any case.

<!-- And by the way if you can read my technical writings [here](https://medium.com/@b.i.n.d.o) please do feel free to give me some feedback :))

## Pronouns - she/her/dudette :smile:
