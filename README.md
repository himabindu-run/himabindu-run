I am a Software Engineer. I love deep work, solving problems, learning new programming languages, building accessible software, painting, reading books, and making lists.

#### What do i do?
- Doing something that will surely leave me with stories to tell and recondition my gut feeling about a lot of things...
- go, python, kube, docker, distributed systems, algorithms, system design - i love everything about backend
- Fixating on elixir and pheonix for next couple of months.
- Sometimes, only If i get paid good enough, i also work on Android Projects
