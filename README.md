I'm a CS undergrad at [GVPCE(A)](http://gvpce.ac.in/index1.html), a Scholar in Google's Women Tech-Makers Engineering Fellows, Core member in GVP-DSC club. 
:zap: I'm kinda **"Jack of all trades"**.

#### What's cooking :grey_question:
- Reading "Learn a you a Haskell for great good" and solving some problems in Haskell.
- Trying to solve more problems. 
- Learning Data Structures and Algorithms(This is never ending).

#### We can talk about...
- Python, C, Cpp, Haskell, Java.
- Mathematics, Data structures, Algorithms, and Competitive programming.
- Stupid-weird-psychological-philosophical things too!

:eyes: No Fun Facts! I'm Fun.
